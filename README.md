# Team-Creator

# Description
The goal of this application was to create a Team creator utilizing javascript, npm and node.js. Also wanted the ability to test each subclass that was created to make sure they worked. I learned how to write test.js for each of the subclass .js that I created and be able to run the test to make sure they work. I was able to learn how to render an HTML only utilizing the terminal. I had difficulty getting the renderHTML to work and be able to write the file once all the prompts through inquirer were answered. I also had difficulty with getting inquirer to work with the different choices of employees.
